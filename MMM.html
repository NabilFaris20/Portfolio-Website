                        My Mechanical Mother is a story-driven VR game based on the experiences of a young genius boy who has recently lost his mother. 
                        In an attempt to recreate the love and care that his mother used to give him, he creates a robot that mimics the actions of 
                        his mother and tries to find happiness in the likeness.

                    <p class="roles">
                        13 year old Ayden is a young boy who is extremely smart and loves inventing and creating. 
                        But one day, Aydenâ€™s mother suddenly passes away which leaves Ayden sad and empty. 
                        We get to see a flashback of his mother teaching him the piano and how much he loved it.
                        He attempts to find a way in order to fill the void he feels. 
                        He is sitting at his table thinking one day when he realizes he had an old robot that had made for an old invention that could work. 
                        He goes to the store room and finds the robot incredibly rusted and in pieces.
                        He takes puts the robot back together before taking it to his fathers lab to begin the restoration of the robots exterior. 
                        After giving the robot a new shiny exterior, Ayden takes the robot back to his office to fix 
                        up the machinery and coding where he turns it on for the first time and sees it come to life.
                        To end things, we see Ayden playing the piano in the company of the robot, 
                        just as his mother used to watch and teach him to play the piano
