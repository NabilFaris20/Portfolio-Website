                    <p class="roles">
                        This game is about a 15 year old boy named Jamil who is trying to save his friend from the clutches of obesity. 
                        Jamilâ€™s friend Siti who he had not seen in a long time returned to the kampung from the city for a vacation. 
                        But there was something different about Siti. She looked like she had become morbidly obese. 
                        Jamil took it into his own hands to attempt to help Siti lose weight and lead a healthier life. Jamil travels to different realms, jumps through trees, runs through mazes and even finds an ancient sorcerer,
                        all in the name of helping his close friend Siti to lose weight. In the end, Siti takes all of Jamils advice and loses a bunch of weight. And before long, they both run through
                        the town hopping and skipping as they had done all those years ago.
